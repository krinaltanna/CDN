High Level Approach:
DNS Server:
1. Create a UDP Socket
2. Accept a dig requet from a client, unpack the question from the query
3. If the question is appropriate, construct a packet with a response as the IP Address of a random EC2 server
4. Send the constructed packet back to the client

HTTP Server:
1. Create an instance of a BaseHTTPServer
2. Make an HTTP socket that listens forever
3. Accept a GET request from the client, and extract the resource
4. Isolate the filename from the resource, and check for local existence
5. If the file exists locally, record a cache hit and return the contents of the local file to the client
6. If the file does not exist, record a cache miss, and redirect the request to the origin EC2 server (ec2-54-85-79-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com)
7. If the file does not exist over there either, send a 404 NOT FOUND message to the client
8. If the file exists, store a copy of the file locally and send the file to the client

Performance Enhancing Techniques:
Implemented a local cache that avoids redirection to the origin server

Challenges:
1. Understanding the requirements
2. Maintaining the cache
3. Testing the code
